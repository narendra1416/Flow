# this is a script to check the currently joined Access Points to a Cisco Wireless Lan Controller.
# It relies on a file, passed as an argument, which contains the access points that "should" exist on said WLC.
# It will report a Critical error if ap's are not there, and a Warning error if an ap is there, but it shouldn't be
# (ie ap there but not in the list)
